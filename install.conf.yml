# dottle config file
# lines starting with a hash are (hopefully) ignored as empty lines


# A command starts in the highest indentations and can be if, link or shell
# every command can take argments that are either flags like
# link: create
# or to disable the flag
# link: !create
# also can take keyword arguments
# link: create=true which is the same as !create
#
# link will create symlinks (for now with absolute paths) to the dotfiles
# folder where this script lives

    Installing submodules: git submodule update --init --recursive
